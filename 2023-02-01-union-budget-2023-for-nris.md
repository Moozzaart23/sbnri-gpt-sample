*Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed to reduce TDS on Mutual Fund dividend payments to NRI investors* u/s 196A of the IT Act.

The Union Budget 2023-24 primarily focuses on infrastructure and investment, green growth and financial sector.

1. The budget proposes to reduce the rate of TDS on the payment of dividends to NRI by any person other than a company u/s 196A of the IT Act. The current rate of TDS is 20% at the time of the payment of such mutual fund income to non-residents.
2. A new NRI tax regime has been introduced, under which income tax rebate limit has been increased to Rs. 7 lakh from Rs. 5 lakh, which means now you don’t have to pay tax for income up to Rs. 7 lakh a year.
3. The rate of TCS for foreign remittance for education and medical treatment will continue to be 5 per cent for remittance exceeding Rs. 7 lakh. Likewise, [TCS rate on foreign remittance](https://sbnri.com/blog/repatriation/how-nris-can-save-tcs-on-foreign-remittance) for education purposes through a loan will also continue to be 0.5 per cent for an amount exceeding Rs. 7 lakh.
4. However, the rate of TCS for foreign remittance for other purposes under [LRS](https://sbnri.com/blog/remittance/liberalised-remittance-scheme) and purchase of overseas trips has been increased from 5 per cent to 20 per cent.
5. The budget proposes the applicability of lower or nil tax deduction at source (TDS) on the interest income of non-resident Indians from wealth and pension funds. Currently business trusts deduct and deposit TDS on the interest income of an NRI @5 per cent.
6. All gifts above Rs 50,000 received by a not-ordinarily resident from a resident Indian as a monetary gift would be deemed to arise in India and would be taxable w.e.f. 1st April 2024.

## NRI Income Tax Slabs and Rates

The Finance Minister announced new tax slabs, which are different from the existing ones. While currently individuals with annual income up to Rs. 5 lakh don’t pay income tax, the rebate limit has been increased to Rs. 7 lakh in the new tax regime.
