## Mutual Funds for NRIs from USA/Canada

Since the implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FACTA), many AMCs (Asset Management Companies) have stopped accepting funds from NRIs residing in the USA and Canada because of lots of paperwork and compliance on the part of mutual fund houses. Under the FACTA, financial players like AMCs, insurance companies and banks are required to furnish their client information to the Government of India that will further be shared with the US/Canadian Government. However, there are mutual funds for NRIs from USA/Canada to invest in India. Here are some of the mutual fund investment options for NRIs based in the USA and Canada:

- Nippon India Mutual Funds
- UTI Mutual Fund
- Navi Mutual Fund
- PPFAS Mutual Fund
- Axis Mutual Fund
- Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund
- [SBI Mutual Fund](https://sbnri.com/blog/nri-mutual-fund/sbi-mutual-funds-for-nris)
- ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund

Each of these AMCs sets different NRI mutual fund investment conditions to accept [investment from NRIs](https://sbnri.com/blog/nri-investment) in Canada and the USA. While some mutual fund houses accept investment only in paper application forms, a few accept online applications through NSE NMFII or BSE STAR MF platforms.

For example, AMC’s like Nippon India, UTI Mutual Fund, and Navi Mutual Fund currently accept the digital declaration\* from NRIs based in the USA and Canada, and the rest accept physical declaration.

- Digital declaration accepted by: Nippon India, UTI Mutual Fund and Navi Mutual Fund
- Physical declaration accepted by: Rest of mutual fund houses that accept investment from the USA and Canada

\*NRI investment in mutual funds in India is subject to certain terms and conditions, and AMCs change their policies from time to time.

The FATCA or the [Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act](https://sbnri.com/blog/nri-investment/fatca-meaning) requires all financial institutions to mandatorily share details of all transactions involving US citizens or NRIs with the US government.

Hence, mutual fund houses must meet all compliance requirements.
